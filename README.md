# Allie Van Wagenen's Code Portfolio

My name is Allie Van Wagenen and I am a passionate and driven engineer currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Applied Operations and Research Engineering at Cornell University, expected to graduate in May 2025. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Operations and Research Engineering with a Minor in Business, also from Cornell, which I completed in May 2024. My academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in optimization, simulation modeling, data science, linear programming, statistical analysis, service system modeling, and manufacturing systems design. I also possess a wide range of technical skills related to coding, including proficiency in Python (NumPy, Pandas, Gurobi, Seaborn, OR-Tools, Scikit-Learn), LaTeX, Java, HTML, SQL, Tableau, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, and Google Collab.
